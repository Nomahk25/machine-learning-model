# Student Performance Predictor

This project predicts a student's final score based on their study habits, attendance, and previous performance.

## 🧠 Features
- Train a machine learning model (RandomForest)
- Predict student final score
- Analyze data visually (notebook)

## 📁 Structure
- `train.py` – trains and saves the model
- `predict.py` – uses the model to make predictions
- `main.py` – interactive input for predictions
- `notebooks/` – visual data analysis
- `data/` – contains sample CSV
- `models/` – stores the trained model

## ✅ How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Train the model:
python train.py


3. Predict:
python predict.py


4. Try the interactive app:
python main.py
